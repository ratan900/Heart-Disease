# Heart-Disease-101803156

## Overview
***
This webapp is used to predict weather the person is suffering from any heart disease and recommends if the person should visit the doctor or not. 
It uses Flask, Machine Learning to do so. First the dataset is imported, then preprossing is done, then visualization is done through matplotlib,
then the data is trained, then the accuracy is checked and finally the prediction has been made. Frontend has been made by using HTML, CSS, javascript and Bootstrap.
Backend is done by using flask. And by flask only the integration has been done between frontend and backend and machine learning pickel files.
